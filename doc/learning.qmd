# Introduction

We can use **many** different kind of setting for a code chunk depending and *what* we want to show.

```{r setup}
#| include: false
# This allow us to hide the messages and warnings
# By adding "setup" it tells markdown that it is a setup chunk, it will allow you to load your library easily when you start R markdown again. We need to add here the libraries we are going to use as well as our data_set

library(tidyverse)
nhanes_small <- read_csv(here::here("data/nhanes_small.csv"))
```

# Method and results

## Analysis


### Table of results

```{r mean-age-bmi-table}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
# When writing those names, always use "-" instead of "_"
# creation of this code chunk by doing command, option, i
# To do | do option 7

nhanes_small %>%
  filter(!is.na(diabetes)) %>%
  group_by(diabetes, education) %>%
  summarize(
    max_bmi = max(bmi, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_bmi = min(bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Mean values of Age and bmi for each diabetes and physical activity status") # Add a heading to the table
```
### Prettier table

It is **important** to not forget to put a space after the #s to do a title

```{r prettier-table}
#| echo: false
nhanes_small %>%
  filter(!is.na(diabetes), !is.na(education)) %>%
  group_by(diabetes, education) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_bmi = mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    # Task 2a.
    mean_age = round(mean_age, 1),
    mean_bmi = round(mean_bmi, 1),
    # Task 2b.
    education = str_to_sentence(education)
  ) %>%
  rename(
    # Task 3.
    "Diabetes Status" = diabetes,
    "Education" = education,
    "Mean Age" = mean_age,
    "Mean BMI" = mean_bmi
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Mean values of Age and BMI for each education and diabetes status.")
```

## 8.10 Inserting figures as files or from R code

**Do not** put a space between the path and the label.
To do this {}, we need to do "option shift 8". 
Inside this bracket {}, it is a *label*, we can then define alignment, size and plenty of parameter.
The label allow us to **reference the image inside the text**.
